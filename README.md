**Data Anonymizer Tool**

**Introduction**
The Data Anonymizer Tool is a Python-based application that provides data anonymization functionalities for sensitive information in CSV files. This tool utilizes different privacy-enhancing techniques to protect sensitive data while maintaining the utility of the original dataset. It supports the following anonymization methods:

Differential Privacy,
Generalization,
Suppression,
Synthetic Data Generation

The application features a user-friendly GUI developed using CustomTkinter for easy interaction with the data.

**Features**

Differential Privacy: Adds noise to numerical columns to preserve privacy.
Generalization: Masks part of the string data with asterisks for anonymization.
Suppression: Replaces rare values in a column with ***.
Synthetic Data Generation: Generates fake data for sensitive string columns using the Faker library.

**GUI:**

Easy-to-use interface to upload data, select anonymization techniques, and save the results.

**Requirements**
To run the project, you will need Python installed along with the required libraries:

pandas,numpy,customtkinter,tkinter,faker


You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/INeuron9/Data-Anonymizer-Tool.git



Run the main script to launch the application:

Upload a CSV file with sensitive data.

Select an anonymization technique.

Enter parameters like epsilon (privacy level) and k (anonymity level).

View both original and anonymized datasets.

Save the anonymized data to a new CSV file.

Usage
1. Uploading a CSV File
Click on the "ðŸ“‚ Upload CSV" button to upload your dataset (in CSV format).

2. Anonymizing Data
Set the epsilon (privacy level) and k (anonymity threshold) values.

Choose the desired anonymization method from the dropdown:

Generalization: Masks part of string data.

Suppression: Replaces rare values with ***.

Synthetic: Generates fake data for string columns.

Click on "ðŸ”’ Anonymize Data" to apply the selected method.

3. Saving Anonymized Data
Click on "ðŸ’¾ Save Anonymized CSV" to save the processed data to a new CSV file.

4. Data Display
The application will display both the original and anonymized data side by side for easy comparison.

A summary section will show the number of records and transformations performed.

Example
Original Data:

Name	Age	Email
John Doe	29	john@example.com
Jane Smith	34	jane@example.com
Sam Brown	45	sam@example.com
Anonymized Data:

Name	Age	Email
John D***	29.14	j***@example.com
Jane S***	34.52	j***@example.com
Sam B***	45.88	s***@example.com
Future Improvements
Additional anonymization techniques for other types of data.

Advanced error handling and validation for user inputs.

Further optimizations for the GUI responsiveness.
